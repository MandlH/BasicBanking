# Why I Chose Hexagonal Architecture

When building this banking application, I wanted an architecture that would make the system robust, easy to maintain, and flexible enough to handle potential future changes. That’s why I chose **Hexagonal Architecture** (also called Ports and Adapters). Here's a breakdown of why this approach was the best fit for this project:

## The Benefits of Hexagonal Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - The core business logic (like managing users, accounts, and transactions) is completely independent of external systems like file storage, the console interface, or cryptography.
   - This makes the core logic reusable and unaffected by changes in other parts of the system.

2. **Testability**:
   - Since the core logic interacts with the outside world only through defined interfaces (ports), it’s easy to test without relying on actual implementations. For example, I can test user registration without worrying about how the data is stored.
   - Mock adapters can be created for testing purposes, making the tests fast and reliable.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Adding new features or switching out components is straightforward. For instance, if I want to move from file-based storage to a database in the future, I only need to update the storage adapter without touching the business logic.
   - Similarly, adding a web interface or other integrations would only require additional adapters.

## How It Works in This Application

1. **Domain Layer**:
   - This is where all the important business logic lives. Classes like `User`, `BankAccount`, and `Transaction` represent the main entities, while services like `UserService` and `TransactionService` handle workflows like registering a user or transferring money.
   - Interfaces like `UserRepositoryPort` and `AccountRepositoryPort` define how the core interacts with storage without being tied to specific implementations.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - This layer handles specific use cases, such as registering a user or performing a transaction. It coordinates workflows between the domain and the adapters.
   - Interfaces like `InputPort` and `OutputPort` ensure the business logic remains decoupled from how requests are received or responses are sent.

3. **Adapters Layer**:
   - The adapters are the bridge between the core logic and external systems. For example:
     - `ConsoleAdapter` handles user input and output.
     - `FileRepositoryAdapter` takes care of saving and loading data from files.
     - `EncryptionAdapter` manages password hashing and data encryption.
     - `LoggingAdapter` logs important events like account creation or failed login attempts.

## Why This Architecture Fits the Project

- **Encapsulation and Security**: Sensitive data like passwords and transaction logs are encrypted, and access to internal data is controlled.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Errors are managed gracefully to avoid crashing the program, and logs are generated to help debug issues without exposing sensitive information.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs (e.g., usernames, passwords, transaction amounts) are validated to ensure the application remains secure and functional.

## Final Thoughts

Hexagonal Architecture gives this application a solid foundation. It’s straightforward to implement and provides the right balance of structure and flexibility. By using this approach, I’ve created a system that meets the current requirements and can easily adapt to future changes without needing major rewrites.
