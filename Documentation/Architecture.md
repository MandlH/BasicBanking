# Why I Chose Onion Architecture

When building this banking application, my priority was to create a system that is maintainable, testable, and flexible. After considering various architectural styles, I chose **Onion Architecture** because it aligns perfectly with these goals.

## Key Reasons for Choosing Onion Architecture

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
Onion Architecture ensures that each layer has a distinct responsibility:
- The **Domain Layer** focuses solely on the business rules, without worrying about technical details like storage or user interfaces.
- The **Application Layer** coordinates workflows, acting as a bridge between the core domain and external systems.
- The **Adapters Layer** handles input/output and infrastructure concerns, such as storage or encryption.

This separation makes the code easier to understand, modify, and extend.

---

### 2. **Independence of the Core**
The **Domain Layer** is at the heart of the application and is completely isolated from external dependencies. This means:
- Business logic doesn’t depend on databases, user interfaces, or frameworks.
- Any changes to external systems (e.g., switching from file-based storage to a database) don’t impact the core business logic.

This independence ensures long-term stability and flexibility.

---

### 3. **Testability**
By isolating the business logic in the Domain Layer, I can write unit tests for the core functionality without relying on external systems like databases or APIs. Mock implementations of the ports (interfaces) allow me to test use cases and workflows independently, ensuring:
- High-quality, bug-free core logic.
- Confidence when making changes or adding new features.

---

### 4. **Flexibility and Extensibility**
With Onion Architecture, adding or replacing components is straightforward. For example:
- If I want to replace the CLI with a web interface, I just need to add a new adapter in the Adapters Layer without touching the Domain or Application Layers.
- If I decide to use a database instead of file-based storage, I can create a new adapter that implements the repository interfaces.

This makes the system future-proof, accommodating evolving requirements.

---

### 5. **Encapsulation of Technical Details**
Infrastructure concerns like encryption, logging, and persistence are encapsulated in the Adapters Layer. This keeps technical complexities out of the business logic, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.

## How This Architecture Fits the Project
For this banking application, Onion Architecture provides:
- A **strong foundation for security**: Sensitive data is processed in isolated, well-defined layers.
- **Resilience against changes**: The core logic remains unaffected by changes to external systems or user interfaces.
- **Scalability**: The modular nature allows easy addition of new features, like a web interface or different storage mechanisms.

By using Onion Architecture, I’ve ensured that this application is not only robust and maintainable but also ready to adapt to future requirements.

## Final Thoughts
Onion Architecture was chosen because it perfectly balances simplicity and robustness. It provides a clear structure that isolates business logic, promotes testability, and simplifies future modifications. For a secure and modular banking application like this, it’s the ideal choice.
